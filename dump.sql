You are prodded awake by Morte, a floating skull and keeper of secrets, to embark on an adventure taking The Nameless One from the dirty streets of Sigil into the mysterious Outer Planes and even into the depths of Hell itself.\n<br><br>\nPortals riddle the planar metropolis of Sigil, providing access to anywhere in existence, but only if you have the proper key. Known as the "City of Doors," Sigil is a neutral ground where demons, devas, and races from across the multiverse gather under the watchful shadow of the Lady of Pain, the city's enigmatic ruler. This is a place where the word is mightier than the sword, where thought defines reality, and belief has the power to reshape worlds.\n<br><br>\nIn your search for answers, you'll find companions matching the bizarre nature of the planes: a chaste succubus who can kill with a kiss, a confused crossbow-wielding cube, a suit of armor animated by a spirit demanding JUSTICE, and more. With these companions and others at The Nameless One’s side, you will explore worlds in search of answers, all to discover that some destinies cannot be escaped and some memories cost more than an even an immortal can bear.\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point"><b>Enhanced Planescape:</b> Chris Avellone, Lead Designer on Planescape Torment, has partnered with Beamdog to curate gameplay updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to best capture his original vision for the game.</li><li class="description__features-point"><b>The Planes Await:</b> Planescape is a setting you've never experienced before, filled with strange magics, bizarre adversaries, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons locations from across the multiverse.</li><li class="description__features-point"><b>Conversations to Remember:</b> Encounter personable items, philosophic undead, and rat hiveminds while walking the planes with the strangest collection of allies ever seen in an RPG.</li><li class="description__features-point"><b>Pick Your Path:</b> Character creation is just the beginning.

You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/01_gif_fight.gif"><br><br><b>Modular stations and ship upgrades:</b><br><br>\nBuilding space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations.\n<br><br>\nShips also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/02_gif_docking.gif"><br><br><b>Most dynamic X universe ever:</b><br><br>\nX4 will be the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/02_x4_store_banner_02.png"><br><b>Managing your empire with a powerful map:</b><br><br>\nOnce you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands.\n<br><br>\nGraphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions.\n<br><br><br><b>Most detailed X economy ever:</b><br><br>\nOne of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.\n<br><br><br><b>Research and Teleportation:</b><br><br>\nThe seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand.\n<br><br>\nEvery order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders.\n<br><br><br><b>Get into the game:</b><br><br>\nIn X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to you to decide.\n\n\n            \n    	161.79	2018-11-29	BR0	20	\N	\N	2021-03-25 18:26:53.701-03	2021-03-25 18:26:53.89-03

Your journey will become their journey, and you’ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/pathfinder_kingmaker/gif/gif_030.gif" style="margin: 15px 0px 5px 0px; width: 600px"><br><br>\nConquer new regions as claim them as your own, carving your kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins — and while dealing with politics in your own court. \n<br><br>\nYour kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor—and to test your strength.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/pathfinder_kingmaker/gif/gif_020.gif" style="margin: 15px 0px 5px 0px; width: 600px"><br><br><h4>Explore - Conquer - Rule!</h4><br><br>\nThe Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is an evolution of the 3.5 rules set of the world's oldest fantasy roleplaying game, designed by Paizo, Inc using the feedback of tens of thousands of gamers just like you.

Your expeditionary force has just completed construction of its first space port in orbit of a new world, but you are not alone. Rivals from the old colonial wars between Earth, Titan, Venus, and the other lineages that divide humankind have also arrived in the same star system.\n<br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/falling_frontier/mp4/Banner.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h4>A New Star System</h4>Explore a vast procedurally generated star system filled with planets, moons, asteroid fields, and nebulae.

A weaker opponent can choose to engage in guerrilla warfare, raiding supply depots and refineries, blockading colonies, and otherwise attacking each point in the enemy supply chain. Likewise, a stronger force cannot simply combine their ships into a single massive and unstoppable fleet and must instead strategically distribute smaller defense flotillas throughout their territory. \n<br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/falling_frontier/mp4/Logistics.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h4>Intel</h4>Use probes, scout ships, and recon stations to explore and monitor the vast emptiness between planets.

It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the <b>AI Storyteller</b>. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.\n<br><br><b>Your colonists are not professional settlers</b> – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.\n<br><br><b>Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play.</b> A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.\n<br><br><b>Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.</b> Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\n<br><br><b>The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.</b> You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\n<br><br><b>Travel across the planet.</b> You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\n<br><br><b>You can tame and train animals.</b> Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\n<br><br><b>People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.</b> They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\n<br><br><b>Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.</b> Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\n<br><br><b>You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.</b> A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.\n<br><br><br>\n(All non-English translations are made by fans.)\n\n\n\n            \n    	59.40	2018-10-16	BR0	19	\N	\N	2021-03-25 18:26:53.72-03	2021-03-25 18:26:53.913-03

In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.<br><br>\nThe player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.<br><br>\nYou can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at.

They’ve spent a lot of time tinkering under the hood to take advantage of new technology and techniques. Bigger levels, hundreds of new colors, and morphing maps that transform mid-level are all just a few of the advancements made to the engine.<br><br><b>Welcome to ION FURY!</b><br><br>\n\n\nShelly “Bombshell” Harrison earned her nickname as a bomb disposal expert for the Global Defense Force. When transhumanist cult mastermind Dr. Jadus Heskel unleashes a cybernetic army on Neo DC, Shelly decides it’s time to start chucking bombs rather than diffusing them.\n<br><br>\nHer journey will leave trails of blood and gore in huge, multi-path levels filled with those famous colorful keycards and plenty of secrets and Easter Eggs to discover behind every corner. There’s also no regenerating health here, so stop taking cover and start running and gunning. Honestly, Ion Fury should probably come out on three hundred floppy disks.\n<br><br>\nShelly’s quest to take down Dr. Heskel’s army will see her use an arsenal of weapons, all with alternate fire modes or different ammo types. Her signature revolver, Loverboy, brings enemies pain and players pleasure with single shots, or Shelly can fan the hammer Old West style. Shotguns are fun, but tossing grenades down their barrels and firing explosive rounds is even better. Bowling Bombs are just as violent and over-the-top as one would hope.\n<br><br>\nIon Fury laughs at the idea of constant checkpoints and straight paths through shooting galleries. But just because this is a true old-school first-person shooter doesn’t mean there won’t be all the good new stuff the last two decades have brought. Headshots? Hell yeah. More physics and interactivity? You betcha. Widescreen, controller support, and Auto Saves? 3D Realms and Voidpoint took the best of both worlds and cooked it all into a bloody stew.\n\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">The true successor to classic shooters such as Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior and Blood.</li><li class="description__features-point">Built using the original "Build" engine, with additional enhancements to further improve the technology.</li><li class="description__features-point">Beautiful hand-crafted artwork, built using original old-school tools and methodologies.</li><li class="description__features-point">7 exciting Zones, each spanning multiple maps.</li><li class="description__features-point">Tons of enemies, weapons and carnage!</li><li class="description__features-point">Best of both worlds!

Thrust into a raging civil war, you watch helplessly as invaders storm your village and slaughter your friends and family. Narrowly escaping the brutal attack, you grab your sword to fight back. Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces!\n\n<h4>Story:</h4>\nBohemia – located in the heart of Europe, the region is rich in culture, silver, and sprawling castles. The death of its beloved ruler, Emperor Charles IV, has plunged the kingdom into dark times: war, corruption, and discord are tearing this jewel of the Holy Roman Empire apart.\nOne of Charles' sons, Wenceslas, has inherited the crown. Unlike his father, Wenceslas is a naive, self-indulgent, unambitious monarch. His half-brother and King of Hungary, Sigismund the Red Fox, senses weakness in Wenceslas. Feigning good will, Sigismund travels to Bohemia and kidnaps his half-brother. With no king on the throne, Sigismund is now free to plunder Bohemia and seize its riches.\n<br><br>\nIn the midst of this chaos, you're Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Your peaceful life is shattered when a mercenary raid, ordered by King Sigismund himself, burns your village to the ground. By bittersweet fortune, you are one of the few survivors of this massacre. \n<br><br>\nWithout a home, family, or future you end up in the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, who is forming a resistance against the invasion. Fate drags you into this bloody conflict and shoves you into a raging civil war, where you help fight for the future of Bohemia.\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point"><b>Massive realistic open world:</b> Majestic castles, vast fields, all rendered in stunning high-end graphics.</li><li class="description__features-point"><b>Non-linear story:</b> Solve quests in multiple ways, then face the consequences of your decisions.</li><li class="description__features-point"><b>Challenging combat:</b> Distance, stealth, or melee.

The player takes the role of a vagrus - a caravan leader who strives to survive in a strange and dangerous dark fantasy world by leading a traveling company on all kinds of ventures.<br><br>\nVagrus is currently in development (in late Alpha) but it already has over fifty hours of playable content. The game is coming to GOG.com in the form of Game in Development in the near future.<br><br>\nThis Demo showcases the beginning sections of the game - both from the more narrative-driven introductory part and from the open-world main campaign.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/vagrus_-_the_riven_realms/dark.png"><br>\nA vast realm is yours to explore, filled with unique locations, strange factions, and a colorful cast of characters. In order to punish the Empire for its sins, the Elder Gods unleashed their power a thousand years ago that ended up devastating the realms.

Positioning and support skills are of paramount importance in these challenging engagements.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/vagrus_-_the_riven_realms/manage.png"><br>\nJourneys have to be planned and prepared for carefully, lest they end in disaster.

Your crew of workers, fighters, scouts, and slaves have to be managed well to optimize their effectiveness.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/vagrus_-_the_riven_realms/characters.png"><br>\nRecruit from a wide variety of companions to have them serve in versatile caravan roles, such as scoutmaster, guard captain, treasure hunter, or beast handler.

From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view.\n<br><br>\nA big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/01_gif_fight.gif"><br><br><b>Modular stations and ship upgrades:</b><br><br>\nBuilding space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations.\n<br><br>\nShips also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/02_gif_docking.gif"><br><br><b>Most dynamic X universe ever:</b><br><br>\nX4 will be the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/02_x4_store_banner_02.png"><br><b>Managing your empire with a powerful map:</b><br><br>\nOnce you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands.\n<br><br>\nGraphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions.\n<br><br><br><b>Most detailed X economy ever:</b><br><br>\nOne of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.\n<br><br><br><b>Research and Teleportation:</b><br><br>\nThe seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand.\n<br><br>\nEvery order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders.\n<br><br><br><b>Get into the game:</b><br><br>\nIn X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to you to decide.\n\n\n            \n    	63.59	2018-11-29	BR0	20	\N	\N	2021-03-25 18:28:06.015-03	2021-03-25 18:28:06.239-03

ARE YOU MAD?:</h4>Since we began development on Dead Cells, many years ago now, we’ve been completely blown away by the amazing reaction of the community. Without your support and feedback we wouldn’t be where we are today. Rise of the Giant is our way of saying thank you. Here’s a free DLC with a bunch of new content, mostly aimed at the people who have been hanging around since day 1, it’s high level and should offer more challenge than most sane people would think reasonable.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_cells_-_rise_of_the_giant/CavernTravelling.gif"><h4>Features:</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>New levels</b>: You’ve got a new level that’s connected to the main level structure and immediately available to anyone who’s finished the game at least once.

As such you will notice that the difficulty has been rebalanced so that the entry level of the game, while extremely challenging is now in line with the 5 extra difficulty levels available to those who like to suffer.\n<br><br>\nWe hope that you like Rise of the Giant and would like to remind you that we’re not done, we’ll be continuing to make content for the game for as long as you keep demanding it, so feel free to let us know what you’d like to see and if we can make any changes that would make you happy.\n\n\n            \n    	0.00	2019-03-27	BR0	57	\N	\N	2021-03-25 18:29:19.988-03	2021-03-25 18:29:20.18-03

Rebel Galaxy Outlaw takes place in a greasy, blue-collar world of outlaws, truckers, cops and thieves. \n<br><br>\nStrap into a variety of spacecraft, settle a score in a filthy space-bar over a game of 8-ball, rock out to over 24 hours of music, and engage in white-knuckle dogfights.\n<br><br>\nIn the Dodge Sector it’s hard to get by – and even harder to get even.\n<br><br>\nRebel Galaxy Outlaw is an open-world space combat adventure game, spread across the nearly 40 systems of the Dodge Sector. Play as a mercenary, a trader, a pirate, or whatever mix of the three you feel fits you best. With an engaging storyline and a full conversation system, you can follow the narrative, or ignore it and forge your own path at any time. \n<br><br>\nEngage in white-knuckle combat, and use the included Autopursuit function to effortlessly fly like an ace, instead of space-jousting for hours. Save up your credits, buy a new ship, kit it out, and then paint it in a fully-fledged 3d-painting application. Make a fortune exploiting lucrative trade routes. Join guilds, help or hunt those in distress, buy and outfit your own space station. Grab a tip in a local bar and hunt hidden treasure. In your down-time, shoot some 8-ball, play some dice-poker, or aim for the high-score in an arcade game in the local seedy watering hole. Flip through the 7 included radio stations and vast music library for just the right track to fit your current mood.\n\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2020 Double Damage Games, Inc.\n        </p>	28.99	2020-09-21	BR0	39	\N	\N	2021-03-25 18:28:05.949-03	2021-03-25 18:28:06.123-03

Lord British has produced a game to challenge not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character.<br><br>\nThe evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain.

One such hero is a farmer in the small village of West Harbor. Raised by the elven ranger, Daeghun, as his own child, our hero will embark on a grandiose quest against the King of Shadows. Neverwinter Nights 2 is the tale of his deeds. His adventures continue in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer. Our protagonist discovers that an ominous spell has fallen on him. A curse of perpetual hunger--one which can only be quelled by consuming the souls of spirits. In order to remove the curse, he has to travel to the Shadow Realm, which harbors dark secrets and tormented souls.\n<br><br>\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir gives as a breather from grand quests of destiny and epic ordeals. You simply assemble a group of four adventurers (either by carefully picking out each of their statistics and skills or by randomly re-rolling your characters until you find the ones that suit you) and go where the wind takes you. Just make sure to get a good look at the map as you will need it to explore the wide open region of Samarach and the Sword Coast. Then, yet another adventure: in an ancient and forgotten tomb you found an unusual mask. It made you quite powerful but changed your life into a living nightmare. Strange, terrifying visions torment your psyche. Every time you try to get rid of the accursed mask, it secretly makes its way back to you. There's just one solution: set sail for Westgate and discover the secret of the Night Masks in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mysteries of Westgate.\n<br><br>\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Complete is an epic RPG set in the fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms, one of the most popular campaign settings of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Use all the wicked spells, feats, and prestige classes from the D&amp;D 3.5 rules. Create your characters any way you wish, choosing from a wide variety of races and subraces, such as Tiefling and Aasimar. As if the pre-made campaigns weren't enough, you can take the reins and use the powerful Obsidian Neverwinter NIghts 2 Toolset to make your own adventures and share them with friends!\n<br><br>\nIf you're looking for a truly epic experience, you can't go wrong with our <b><a href="http://www.gog.com/news/mod_spotlight_baldurs_gate_reloaded_nwn2_mod">Mod Spotlight for Neverwinter Nights 2 Complete!</a></b><ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Neverwinter Nights 2: Complete includes the original game, and three expansions: Mask of the Betrayer, Storm of Zehir, and Mysteries of Westgate.</li><li class="description__features-point">Create and host your own solo and multiplayer D&amp;D adventures using the improved Neverwinter Nights 2 Toolset.</li><li class="description__features-point">Rediscover many familiar locations and reunite with your companions from the Neverwinter Nights series.</li><li class="description__features-point">More than 100 hours of immersive adventure across four campaigns, all rendered in breathtaking detail.</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2013 Wizards.

You will traverse a vast open world, rich with merchant cities, dangerous mountain passes, and forgotten caverns to explore. It's survival of the fittest - deal with treasonous generals, devious witches and corrupt royalty to provide dark and dangerous services, then invest your rewards to upgrade your equipment, or spend them away on pleasures of the night.\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt © 2014 CD Projekt S.A.

Combine those with the basic platforming abilities like jumping and crawling that you’re familiar with from every platforming game ever, and you’ve got the basics of a phenomenal romp across a huge world filled with treasure, maps, secrets, danger, and triumph.\n<br><br>\nThe music changes with the environments and day-night cycles, enhancing the feel the game is evoking and making you feel immersed in the world as you travel through it. The game has a retro feel, yes, but you really have to see it for yourself to understand what Treasure Adventure Game brings to the table. Since it’s free, of course, there is simply no reason not to!\n<br><br>\nTreasure Adventure Game was created by Stephen Orlando. He spent over 2 years of his life developing it. When you see the scope and detail in this game, it’s hard to believe that it was created by just one guy. But it was!

Consuming those who submit, eradicating those who resist. With none to oppose his ascendance, the circle will be complete, and an ancient age will begin anew.\n<br><br>\nWhat fate will befall the Second Age of Man?

Such is the adrenaline-fueled thrill of The Looter.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/1.gif"><br><h4>STORY</h4>\nThe world is coming to an end. Everything is lost and destroyed, humanity is in disarray. Somewhere in this world there is Tortura, a giant forest that devoured the monuments of a past civilization. Tortura is a dangerous place. Not many people decide to live there, and those who dare are hiding behind thick walls and sleeping with their guns by their side. <br>\nThe story begins when the protagonist, a nameless looter, and his comrades reach the Watch Tower. It’s an old construction placed at the edge of Tortura, the last safe place with a vague sense of civilization. The pack is to be hired by the emissary of a local magnate hoping to find a cure for his terminal disease. The cure is supposedly in the Monastery,  a place where even the bravest looters don’t dare to venture. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/2.gif"><br><br>\nWhile making his way through Tortura, the protagonist is attacked and critically wounded by a strange creature. With no signs of life, his pack leaves him, presuming him dead. After some time, the protagonist wakes up fully healed, alone in seclusion. Abandoned and with no other choice, he decides to continue his way to the monastery, hoping to find his friends. While exploring the forest, meeting potentially dangerous strangers, looting everything in sight, and fighting ruthless creatures, the protagonist gets involved in events that will uncover the tragic story of Tortura with great evil lurking in the shadows.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/3.gif"><br><h4>RANGE &gt; MELEE</h4>\nThe Looter is all about bringing a gun to a mutant fight. Focused on using firearms such as the handgun, shotgun and assault rifle you will learn to dispatch all enemies with ease aiming at 360 angle before they get too close. And if they do? Trusty fireaxe and a variety of equipment such as frag grenades, flashbangs and landmines should do the trick.\n<br><h4>SECRET GARDENS</h4>\nTortura is full of secrets and hidden places and investigating them is rewarded. You will often have to be cunning, perceptive and curious to uncover every secret that this world keeps from you.\n<br><h4>MOOD BOARDS</h4>\nTortura is an empty, sombre place and you will have a chance to explore this strange yet familiar setting. Get ready to visit dilapidated buildings, deserted bunkers, empty bases while all the time on the lookout for more loot and deadly creatures that are always dangerously close. \n<br><h4>GET CRAFTY</h4>\nWhile gathering loot, players can also acquire materials that are used for crafting usable items. As the game progresses, the player will gain new blueprints and recipes for crafting certain items.\n<br><h4>THE LOOT</h4>\nOn your journey you will encounter all sorts of artefacts from the days gone - both carrying sentimental and more practical value. Find and bag items that you can collect, exchange and craft into new useful tools. \n\n            \n    	566.79	1969-12-31	BR0	85	\N	\N	2021-12-19 23:19:45.562-03	2021-12-19 23:19:45.674-03

Mostly because it actually has been. The side project that was supposed to take a few months instead sprawled into a retail game that has taken several years to complete.\n<br><br>\nBrave Earth wears its influences a bit... shamelessly on its sleeve. The game was originally conceived to be a freeware "study" game for me -- learning through emulation. But the product I'm releasing is more than just emulation. I've tried my best to both understand and then build upon one of my favorite eras in platformers to almost arrive at a uniquely different alternative reality. A more modern sensibility without playing like a modern take on a retro game.\n<br><br>\nAs George Lucas's Star Wars built upon and paid tribute Flash Gordon while establishing its own voice, I'm hoping Brave Earth can do the same.\n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/brave_earth_prologue/pub.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>\nThis is Dan Stern from Dangen Entertainment. I’m both pleased and proud to present Brave Earth: Prologue. \n<br><br>\nI’ve said in other places how happy I am for pixel art to have made a come back with the independent development scene. The pixel art in BEP is excellent, but what I have found to stand out and amaze me in this game is the meticulous care that Kayin put into designing the encounters. It doesn’t come as any surprise to me considering his previous work, but in no time at all I got the feeling that he was in my own head in a sense. \n<br><br>\nKayin’s complete understanding of player psychology is as enviable as it is rare in game development. I Wanna Be the Guy was a game that was completely designed around it. Traps spring up and invisible blocks bar your path, leading to your frequent death. It was almost as much a commentary on game design in a meta sense as it was a clever arrangement of platforming puzzles. \n<br><br>\nIn Brave Earth: Prologue, by contrast, traps and obstacles are laid bare before you. This is not a game meant to trick you cleverly, but rather to masterfully utilize a comprehensive understanding of what makes for a satisfying challenge.\n<br><br>\nIt’s remarkable that the game also leads the player along a logical path through the game’s world, with three totally different playable characters, no less. While level-based rather than open world, BEP still gave me a powerful sense of progress, journey and adventure. To find that depth of setting in a game with so much attention paid to the gameplay balance is impressive to say the least.\n<br><br>\nI couldn’t be more proud to work with a talented developer like Kayin. This game is a masterpiece of 8-bit era game design and it vastly raises the bar in my eyes as a gamer. I can’t wait for you all to experience it.\n\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT is a trademark of Dangen Entertainment.\nCopyright © 2017 Dangen Entertainment.

Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle.  \n<br><br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/citizen_sleeper/mp4/Drone_Tracking_Store_GIF.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/citizen_sleeper/Life_on_Erlin_s_Eye.gif"><br>\nAn abandoned station on the edge of a system in crisis.

It is a game about crisis and permanent conflict in human society. You will run out of vital resources in times you need them the most. People will protest and riot despite your best efforts to help them. Not everyone will survive.\n<br><br>\nYou’ll have to run a city with limited resources. To balance between people's needs and city development. To deal with angry crowds on the streets. You are the one to shape the future of your people. Just remember - there is no way to make everyone happy.\n<br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/kapital_sparks_of_revolution/1_DIVIDED_SOCIETY.png" alt=""></p><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/kapital_sparks_of_revolution/mp4/Gif2_CityLife.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>\n\n\nThe population of your city consists of 3 classes: nobles, bourgeois and workers. Each class has a unique role in the city economy. Nobles serve as officials and policemen, bourgeois pay taxes while workers provide the labor force. Their vision of the future is very different and they are ready to fight for it.\n<br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/kapital_sparks_of_revolution/2_CRISIS_MANAGEMENT.png" alt=""></p><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/kapital_sparks_of_revolution/mp4/Gif3_Protest.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>\n\nRunning the city is not an easy task. Your resources are limited while people’s demands are high. You have to decide who will get food and shelter first. Be prepared to face new threats on a regular basis. Epidemics, accidents, sabotages, hostage situations - the city will fall apart unless you make a difference.\n<br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/kapital_sparks_of_revolution/3_PROTESTS_AND_RIOTS.png" alt=""></p><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/kapital_sparks_of_revolution/mp4/Gif4_Riot.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>\n\n\nPeople whose needs go unsatisfied will hold a grudge against your rule. Some of them will become dissidents and radicals. They will form secret societies to overthrow you. Protests on the streets will turn into massacres and riots. You have to make a tough choice of which class to support and which to suppress.\n<br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/kapital_sparks_of_revolution/4_SHAPING_THE_FUTURE_.png" alt=""></p><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/kapital_sparks_of_revolution/mp4/Gif5_Train.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>\n\n\nYou will research new technologies and adopt new laws to improve the lives of your citizens. You will fight crime, tackle corruption and maintain order on the streets. As a ruler of the city, you have the ultimate power to shape the future of your society. The question is how far will you go to reach that goal?\n\n\n            \n    	566.79	1969-12-31	BR0	101	\N	\N	2021-12-19 23:19:46.251-03	2021-12-19 23:19:46.345-03
